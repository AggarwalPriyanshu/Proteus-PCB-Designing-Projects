A professional collection of electronic circuit designs and PCB layouts developed using the **Proteus Design Suite**. This repository showcases various automated systems and digital logic circuits from conceptual schematics to production-ready PCB visualizations.

## 🚀 Projects Overview

This repository contains the following key electronic projects:

* **Automatic Street Light:** An LDR-based system that automatically controls lighting based on ambient light levels.
* **Battery Voltage Monitor:** A circuit designed to track and display battery charge status.
* **Clap Switch:** A sound-activated switch that toggles electrical loads via a microphone input.
* **Fire Alarm:** A safety system that detects heat or smoke to trigger an audible alarm.
* **Water Level Indicator:** A monitoring system for fluid levels in tanks or containers.
* **Full Adder & Full Subtractor:** Core digital electronics implementations for arithmetic operations.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each project folder contains the following essential files:
- **`.pdsprj`**: The primary Proteus project file (ISIS Schematic + ARES Layout).
- **`.jpg`**: Visual documentation including Circuit Diagrams, PCB Layouts, and 3D Visualizer outputs.
- **`CADCAM.ZIP`**: Fabrication-ready files for PCB manufacturing.
- **`.workspace`**: Environment settings for specific workstations.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/AggarwalPriyanshu/Proteus-PCB-Designing-Projects.git](https://github.com/AggarwalPriyanshu/Proteus-PCB-Designing-Projects.git)
    ```
2.  **Requirements:**
    - You must have **Proteus Design Suite (v8.0 or higher)** installed to open the project files.
3.  **Simulation & Layout:**
    - Open the desired project folder.
    - Launch the `.pdsprj` file.
    - Use the **Play** button for real-time simulation or the **3D Visualizer** icon to view the final board design.
